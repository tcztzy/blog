# Large Language Models

Since there are many large language models, we will discuss how to use them and how to fine-tune them for specific tasks.

## What is a large language model?

A large language model is a model that can generate text. It is trained on a large corpus of text, and can be used to generate text.

## Why language models matter?

All knowledge is encoded in text, even multimedia data can be described by text exactly.
Language models can be used to generate text, and can be used to answer questions, summarize text, and perform other natural language processing tasks.

## Why scaling matters?

The performance of language models is often measured by the number of parameters. The more parameters a model has, the better it performs. This is known as the scaling hypothesis.

## How to use language models?

Microsoft released a [JARVIS](https://github.com/microsoft/JARVIS), which is a framework for building a workflow in ML.
