# Genome simulation

Genome simulation is the process of generating artificial genomes that mimic the real genomes of organisms. It is a powerful tool for testing the performance of various bioinformatics algorithms and software tools. For example, genome simulation can be used to evaluate the accuracy of variant calling algorithms, the power of association tests, and the performance of population genetics methods.

## Reads simulation

Reads simulation is the process of generating artificial reads from a reference genome.
