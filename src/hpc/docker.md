# Docker in HPC

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to run applications in an isolated environment. This means that you can run applications without having to worry about dependencies or conflicts with other applications on the system. Docker is a great tool for reproducible research because it allows you to create a container with all of the dependencies needed to run your code. This container can then be shared with others so that they can run your code without having to worry about installing dependencies.
