## Setup and Configuration

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free source code editor developed by Microsoft. It has built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. It also has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

With the Remote - SSH extension, you can open any folder on a remote machine with SSH and work with it just like it was a local folder.

Compare with VIM/Emacs, Visual Studio Code is more user-friendly and easy to use. It is a good choice for beginners.

> [!NOTE]
> From vscode 1.86, because of the embedding node.js had been upgraded to 18.x, Remote - SSH extension may not work properly. If you encounter this problem, you can downgrade vscode to 1.85.2.
