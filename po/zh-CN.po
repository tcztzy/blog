"Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and "
"software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary "
"field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, "
"information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret "
"biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of "
"biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques. "
"Bioinformatics is both an umbrella term for the body of biological studies "
"that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as a "
"reference to specific analysis \"pipelines\" that are repeatedly used, "
"particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include "
"the identification of candidate genes and nucleotides (SNPs). Often, such "
"identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic "
"basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in "
"agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal "
"way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organizational principles "
"within nucleic acid and protein sequences, called proteomics."

"计算机分析。生物信息学既是一个涵盖生物学研究的术语，又是指特定的分析“管道”，"
"这些管道在基因组学领域特别是重复使用。生物信息学的常见用途包括候选基因和核苷"
"酸（SNP）的鉴定。通常，这种鉴定是为了更好地理解疾病的遗传基础、独特的适应性、"
"理想的特性（尤其是在农业物种中）或不同种群之间的差异。在一个不太正式的方式"
"中，生物信息学也试图理解核酸和蛋白质序列内部的组织原则，称为蛋白质组学。"
